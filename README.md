# HiveMQ_Broker

## Introduction
This is a school project, where I will use the Arduino MKR WiFi 1010 board.

## RGB connection status.
We want to show the connection status when the board starts up - to tell a user how far it is in its connection process.
 - When it starts up, it needs to disaply the color red, to indicate that the board isn't connected.
 - Once it starts initializing, then the color yellow needs to be showing.
 - When finally connected to everything, it will be displaying the color green.
